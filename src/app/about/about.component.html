                    NOIZ Promotions was born under a grey sky in early 2015, and starting as we meant to go on, we held a dozen more events within
                    a year of our first show taking place.

                <p>
                    In this time we booked over 100 bands and artists, from local newcomers to international touring acts, and we also booked
                    UK tours for a handful of select acts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From our flagship all-dayers to the weekday gigs, every one of our events is given the full care and attention it deserves.
                    Our work ethic and lineups have seen NOIZ quickly gaining a reputation as one of the UK's most respected
                    heavy music promoters.
